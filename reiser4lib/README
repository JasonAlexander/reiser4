This is a library for reiserfs filesystem access and manipulation.
The primary goal is to develop the nice, full functionality library 
wich might be linked against any projects which needed reiserfs filesystem 
access. There are GNU Parted, GNU GRUB, Yaboot, Partimage, EVMS, etc.

The second goal is high maintainability source code.

The third goal is to develop an alternative set of the reiserfsprogs as 
small and nice frontends to this library.

For now progsreiserfs consists of:
1. libreiserfs, which have a number of high level APIs for access reiserfs 
   filesystem. There are: main filesystem code (reiserfs_fs_open, reiserfs_fs_close, 
   resierfs_fs_create, reiserfs_fs_resize, reiserfs_fs_journal_tune, etc), journal 
   code, bitmap code, directories and files access code and device abstraction layer.
2. fouth progs which are simple frontends to libreiserfs. There are: mkfs.reiserfs,
   resizefs.reiserfs, cpfs.reiserfs, tunefs.reiserfs.
   
progsreiserfs supports versions 3.5, 3.6 with standard and relocated journal.
Also all possible blocksizes which supported by kernel (2.4.18 with patches or 2.4.19)

The project homepage is http://reiserfs.linux.kiev.ua

In order to check whether libreiserfs works fine you should run regression tests which
lie in debug directory. Just run *test* bash script. Unfortunately not the all features 
will be tested (example, files and directory access API) because right testing requered 
mounting of the loop device and mounting of reiserfs with blocksize which not equals 
4096 bytes is dangerous yet!

Send bug reports, requests for help, feature requests, comments, etc. to

(see the AUTHORS file).
