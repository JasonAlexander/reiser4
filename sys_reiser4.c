/* System call for accessing enhanced semantics of the Reiser Filesystem Version 4 (reiser4). */

/* This system call feeds a string to parser.c, parser.c converts the
   string into a set of commands which are executed, and then this
   system call returns after the completion of those commands. */

/* Please read parser.c and return. */

/* Mr. Demidov, please implement by the end of March. */
