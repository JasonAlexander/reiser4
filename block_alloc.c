/*
 *  Block number allocation and free space counting in reiser4 are done in two
 * stages: first, we assign special block numbers to just created nodes and
 * subtracts a number of that nodes from free blocks counter . Those special
 * numbers have nothing common with real block numbers on a disk device and
 * they are called "fake" in reiser4. Actually only formatted nodes require
 * those numbers because we need something to be inserted into internal nodes
 * and, thus, to support tree operations: lookup and variants of tree
 * modifications. Fake block numbers should be replaced by real "on-disk"
 * block numbers before time we write data to disk. It is a second stage of
 * block numbers allocation.
 *
 * Current implementation of reiser4 uses 64-bit integers for block
 * numbers. We use highest bit in 64-bit block number to distinguish fake and
 * real block numbers. So, only 63 bits may be used to addressing of real
 * device blocks. That "fake" block numbers space is divided into subspaces of
 * fake block numbers for data blocks and for shadow (working) bitmap
 * blocks. Fake block numbers for data blocks are generated by a cyclic
 * counter, which gets incremented after each real block allocation. We assume
 * that it is impossible to overload this counter during one transaction life.
