README file for bench package.

Bench is a set of simple shell scripts to perform automated benchmarking.

Goal of bench package is to run (potentially long) series of benchmarks
varying some parameters from run to run.

At the top level bench main entry point is driver.sh. This script is supposed
to be called directly from rc.d (powerhouse.namesys.com has hook for this in
/etc/init.d/rc1.d).

driver.sh:    handles queues of tests: todo/, current/, and done/ with obvious
meaning.

functions.sh: contains common functions that tests are supposed to use:
create, mount, umount file system, reboot, create report file, etc.

Each test is represented by directory (initially within todo/). The only thing
driver.sh requires from test is existence of executable run.me file within
test directory.
