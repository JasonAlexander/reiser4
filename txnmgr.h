/* TYPE DEFINITIONS */

/* A note on lock ordering: the handle & jnode spinlock protects reading of their ->atom
   fields, so typically an operation on the atom through either of these objects must (1)
   lock the object, (2) read the atom pointer, (3) lock the atom.

   During atom fusion, the process holds locks on both atoms at once.  Then, it iterates
   through the list of handles and pages held by the smaller of the two atoms.  For each
   handle and page referencing the smaller atom, the fusing process must: (1) lock the
   object, and (2) update the atom pointer.

   You can see that there is a conflict of lock ordering here, so the more-complex
   procedure should have priority, i.e., the fusing process has priority so that it is
   guaranteed to make progress and to avoid restarts.

   This decision, however, means additional complexity for aquiring the atom lock in the
   first place.

   The general original procedure followed in the code was:

       TXN_OBJECT *obj = ...;
       TXN_ATOM   *atom;

       spin_lock (& obj->_lock);

       atom = obj->_atom;

       if (! spin_trylock_atom (atom))
         {
           spin_unlock (& obj->_lock);
           RESTART OPERATION, THERE WAS A RACE;
         }

       ELSE YOU HAVE BOTH ATOM AND OBJ LOCKED


   It has however been found that this wastes CPU a lot in a manner that is
   hard to profile. So, proper refcounting was added to atoms, and new
   standard locking sequence is like following:

       TXN_OBJECT *obj = ...;
       TXN_ATOM   *atom;

       spin_lock (& obj->_lock);

       atom = obj->_atom;

       if (! spin_trylock_atom (atom))
         {
           atomic_inc (& atom->refcount);
           spin_unlock (& obj->_lock);
           spin_lock (&atom->_lock);
           atomic_dec (& atom->refcount);
           // HERE atom is locked
           spin_unlock (&atom->_lock);
           RESTART OPERATION, THERE WAS A RACE;
         }

       ELSE YOU HAVE BOTH ATOM AND OBJ LOCKED

   (core of this is implemented in trylock_throttle() function)

   See the jnode_get_atom() function for a common case.

   As an additional (and important) optimization allowing to avoid restarts,
   it is possible to re-check required pre-conditions at the HERE point in
   code above and proceed without restarting if they are still satisfied.
