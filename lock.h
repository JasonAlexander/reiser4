	   when requested lock not on this lock_stack but which it wishes to

	   instead of wait_queue_t object due to locking problems (lost wake
	   up). "lost wakeup" occurs when process is waken up before he actually
	   becomes 'sleepy' (through sleep_on()). Using of semaphore object is
	   simplest way to avoid that problem.
	  
	   A semaphore is used in the following way: only the process that is
	   the owner of the lock_stack initializes it (to zero) and calls
	   down(sema) on it. Usually this causes the process to sleep on the
	   semaphore. Other processes may wake him up by calling up(sema). The
	   advantage to a semaphore is that up() and down() calls are not
	   required to preserve order. Unlike wait_queue it works when process
	   is woken up before getting to sleep. 
	  
	   NOTE-NIKITA: Transaction manager is going to have condition variables
	   (&kcondvar_t) anyway, so this probably will be replaced with
	   one in the future.
	  
	   After further discussion, Nikita has shown me that Zam's implementation is
	   exactly a condition variable.  The znode's {zguard,requestors_list} represents
	   condition variable and the lock_stack's {sguard,semaphore} guards entry and
	   exit from the condition variable's wait queue.  But the existing code can't
	   just be replaced with a more general abstraction, and I think its fine the way
	   it is. */
